            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p class="lead">At My Easy Therapy, we're on a mission to provide exceptional therapy services to children with autism and their families. Our founder, [founder name], understands firsthand the challenges of caring for a child with autism, which is why she started My Easy Therapy with a vision to provide a lifetime of support to families just like hers.

              As a parent of a child with autism, [founder name] spent countless hours searching for the right therapy services for her daughter. At one point, she had to travel hours to find the right care, which is why she's passionate about offering a one-stop-shop for families looking for high-quality therapy services.
